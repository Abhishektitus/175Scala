Problem Scenario 4: You have been given MySQL DB with following details. 
user=retail_dba 
password=cloudera 
database=retail_db 
table=retail_db.categories 
jdbc URL = jdbc:mysql://quickstart:3306/retail_db 
Please accomplish following activities. 
Import Single table categories(Subset data) to hive managed table, where category_id between 1 and 22 

So the following is the answer but not clear nor working:
sqoop import \
--connect jdbc:mysql://ms.itversity.com/retail_db \
--username=retail_user \
--password=itversity \
--table=categories \
--where "category_id between 1 and 22" \
--hive-import  

Unfortunately it is not working with the following error:
FAILED: IllegalStateException Unxpected Exception thrown: Unable to fetch table categories. org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: Permission denied: user=paslechoix, access=EXECUTE, inode="/user/narendrareddy/categories":narendrareddy:hdfs:drwx------


I thought maybe I need to indicate hive-home?  so I added 
--hive-home paslechoix
(paslechoix is my user id on lab)

I removed the created directory on hdfs and run the import again with the new option, I got the same error:

FAILED: IllegalStateException Unxpected Exception thrown: Unable to fetch table categories. org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: Permission denied: user=paslechoix, access=EXECUTE, inode="/user/narendrareddy/categories":narendrareddy:hdfs:drwx------

Can anyone please help me? Thank you very much.
