Problem Scenario 29 : Please accomplish the following exercises using HDFS command line options. 
1. Create a directory in hdfs named hdfs commands. 
2. Create a tile in hdfs named data.txt in hdfs commands. 
3. Now copy this data.txt tile on local filesystem, however while copying tile please make sure file properties are not changed e.g. file permission 
4. Now create a tile in local directory named data_local.txt and move this tile to hdfs in hdfs commands directory. 
5. Create a file data_hdfs.txt in hdfs_commands directory and copy it to local file system. 
6. Create a file in local filesystem named filel.txt and put it to hdfs 
==================================================================================
Solution : 

Step 1 : Create directory 

hdfs dfs -mkdir hdfs commands 
Step 2 : Create a file in hdfs named data.txt in hdfs commands. 
hdfs dfs -touchz hdfs_commands/data.txt 
Step 3 : Now copy this data.txt file on local filesystem, however while copying file please make sure file properties are not changed e.g. file permissions.
hdfs dfs -copyToLocal -p hdfs_commands/data.txt /home/cloudera/Desktop/HadoopExam 
Step 4 : Now create a file in local directory named data_local.txt and move this file to hdfs in hdfs_commands directory. 
touch data_local.txt 
hdfs dfs -moveFromLocal /home/cloudera/Desktop/HadoopExam/data_local.txt hdfs_commands/ 
Step 5 : Create a file data_hdfs.txt in hdfs commands directory and copy it to local file system. 
hdfs dfs -touchz hdfs commands/data_hdfs.txt 
hdfs dfs -get hdfs_-commands/data_hdfs.txt /home/cloudera/Desktop/HadoopExam/ 
Step 6 : Create a file in local filesystem named file1.txt and put it to hdfs 
touch file1.txt 
hdfs dfs -put /home/cloudera/Desktop/HadoopExam/file1 .txt hdfs_commands/
