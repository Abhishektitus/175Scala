Problem Scenario 66 : You have been given below code snippet. 
val a = sc.parallelize(List("dog", "tiger", "lion", "cat", "spider", "eagle"), 2) 
val b = a.keyBy(_.length) 
val c = sc.parallelize(List("ant", "falcon", "squid"), 2) 
val d = c.keyBy(_.length) 
operation 1 
Write a correct code snippet for operationl which will produce desired output, shown below. 
======================================================================== 
Solution : 
b.subtractByKey(d).collect 
subtractByKey [Pair] : Very similar to subtract, but instead of supplying a function, the key-component of each pair will be automatically used as criterion for removing items from the first RDD.
