Problem Scenario 23 : You have been given log generating service as below. 
start_logs (It will generate continuous logs) 
tail _ logs (You can check , what logs are being generated) 
stop_logs (It will stop the log servoce) 
Path where logs are generated using above service : /opt/gen_logs/logs/access.log 
Now write a flume configuration file named flume3.conf, using that configuration file dumps logs in HdFS file system in a directory called flume3/%y/%m/%d/%H%M
(Means every minute new directory should be created). Please us the interceptors to provide timestamp information, it message header does not have header info.
And also note that you have to preserve existing timestamp, it message contains it. 
Flume channel should have following property as well. After every 100 message it should be committed, use non-durable/faster channel and it should be able to hold maximum 1000 events.
Solution : 
Step 1 : Create flume configuration file, with below configuration for source, sink and channel. 
#Define source , sink , channel and agent. 
agent1.sources = source1 
agent1.sinks = sink1 
agent1.channels = channel1
# Describe/configure source1 
Agent1.sources.source1 .type = exec 
agent1.sources.source1.command = tail -F /opt/gen_logs/logs/access.log 
#Define interceptors 
agent1.sources.sourcel.interceptors=i1 
Agent1.sources.source1. interceptors.i1.type=timestamp 
agent1.sources.source1. interceptors.i1.preserveExisting=true 
## Describe sink1
agent1.sinks.sink1.channel = memory-channel 
agent1.sinks.sink1.type = hdfs 
agent1.sinks. sink1.hdts.path = flume3/% y/%m/%d/%H%M
agent1 .sinks.sink1 .hdfs.fileType = DataStream 
# Now we need to define channel1 property. 
agent1.channels.channel1.type = memory 
agent1.channels.channel1.capacity = 1000 
agent1 .channels.channel1 .transactioncapacity = 100 
# Bind the source and sink to the channel 
agent1.sources.source1.channels = channel1 
agent1.sinks.sink1 .channel = channel1

Step 2 : Run below command which will use this configuration file and append data in hdfs. 
Start log service using : start_logs 
Start flume service : 
flume-ng agent ---conf/home/cloudera/flumeconf â€”conf-file /home/cloudera/flumeconf/flume3.conf -Dflume.root.logger=DEBUG,lNFO,console  --name agent1
Wait for few mins and than stop log service. 
stop_logs
